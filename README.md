Created for a video idea I have on the structure of the edgar api.
It creates a dataframe for annual data that works as intended currently. It also creates a dataframe for quarterly data
I need to figure out a way to generalize filling missing values. Currently have the idea to take the annual data and subtract off the given quarters to get the missing. 
If you have any suggestions or would like to give any ideas/help feel free to email me :)
this has been my way of learning how to program by doing rather than just following a tutorial so please dont judge my spagetti code to harshly.
I am getting it to work first then making it beautiful later
