# Next Steps
- use the submissions endpoint to get company info, name, financial year end, sic
- create a function that takes in a CIK and returns the annual dataframe for that company as well as quarterly basically what i did just split it into two more functions
- rewrite the edgar_funcs.py file to use a class
- use the logic from the concept_parser to to better parsse the facts dataframes
- get streamlit working to display the dataframes and gives the ability to download the dataframes as csv files as well as the ability to add features
- find a way to parse the 10q xml files to get the tags used in the filings for the main financial statements (lxml ET.iterparse)
- find the different names for the main tags so that they can be used in if statements to quickly parse the facts dataframes
- combine the different companies into a dataset for annual data that uses an outer join to combine the dataframes so it preserves all the columns
- get started on the optimatl features to add to the annual dataframes to be used in the machine learning model
- PULL INTERESTING DATA FROM FRED AND ADD IT TO THE DATAFRAME
- contribute to openml so that the dataset can be used by others
